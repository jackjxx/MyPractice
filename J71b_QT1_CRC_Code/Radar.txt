Summary:
Request to add Magnesium CRC test at IQC, IPAD-1 and QT1 so we can screen for OTP retention failures. See attached source code.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Read register 0x7B and 0x7C to check if CRC codes are programmed:
     If 0x7B == 0x0000 or 0xFFFF, then CRC codes are not programmed, no need for CRC
     If 0x7C == 0x0000 or 0xFFFF, then CRC codes are not programmed, no need for CRC
     Otherwise proceed to step 3 to continue CRC check
2. Generate CRC code for register 0x40 
     a. Please refer to attached sample code written in python
     b. Function input "crc" is the initial CRC value which is 0xFFFF
     c. Function input "byte" is the current register value
3. Repeat step 3 on registers 0x41 ~ 0x7A, 0x7D ~ 0x7F
     a. Please refer to attached sample code written in python
     b. Function input "crc" is the CRC code generated from the previous register value
     c. Function input "byte" is the current register value
4. Final CRC code should be 2-bytes long:
     a. High byte of CRC code (bit 15 ~ bit 8) should be compared with register 0x7B
     b. Second byte of CRC code (bit 15 ~ bit 8) should be compared with register 0x7C
     c. If both values match with the programmed codes then return "PASS", otherwise return “FAIL”
